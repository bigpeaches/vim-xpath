XPath search plugin for vim and validation.

When editing an XML file, you can press SHIFT+X to enter XPath search mode. Begin typing your xpath, and press TAB for context-sensitive xpath completion.
A new results window will pop up beneath the current window, with results matching your XPath, or if the XML file is not valid, the position of the validation error.
Hitting enter jumps to the results window, and then hitting enter on one of the results jumps to the line in your XML file that matched (or the position of the error).

Requires:
-Vim with python support
-python lxml library installed (ideally 2.7 or higher)

To install:
-Place all files into your vimXX or .vim directory


TODO:
-Neaten up configuration etc.
-Create vimdocs
-Make a vimball for easy installation
-Write a post/create a video demo showing the plugin in action!
